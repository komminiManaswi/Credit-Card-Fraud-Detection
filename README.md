# EnsembleLearning-DetectCreditCardFraud
 Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to individuals and businesses in the digital era. Conventional
 rule-based systems struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics employed by fraudsters. The project report explains all the pre-processing steps and how the data 
 imbalance issue is addressed.
 Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated through various metrics to achieve an accuracy of 100%. 
 This project addresses the challenge by developing a machine learning-based credit card fraud detection system. Leveraging a Kaggle dataset
 encompassing diverse transactional data, our approach involves comprehensive preprocessing, feature extraction, and
 predictive modeling. The proposed system aims to distinguish legitimate from fraudulent transactions, utilizing advanced
 algorithms such as Support Vector Machines or Random Forest classifiers. Evaluation metrics, including precision, recall,
 and F1 score, are employed for a thorough analysis. Comparative studies against classic methods, such as decision trees
 and SVMs, demonstrate the superiority of our model. Case studies further illustrate its efficacy in identifying fraudulent
 activities. It contributes to the ongoing discourse on credit card fraud detection, providing a robust and adaptive
 solution to combat this evolving threat in the financial landscape.This project aims to detect credit card fraud using Binary classification algorithms for a highly imbalanced dataset.
